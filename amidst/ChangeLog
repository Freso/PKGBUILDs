	* 3.6_beta_3-1 :
	Version bump. Note the changed license.

	Upstream changelog:
	- Switching/creating maps will no longer consume extra memory. (This means that you'll no long have issues with excess memory usage when you cycle through many different seeds)
	- Added automatic seed histories. If AMIDST detects a "history.txt" file next to it, it will write a time stamp followed by the seed for each seed you enter.
	- In addition to "history.txt" you may also use the "-history someFileOrPath.txt" (or whatever extension you'd like) to specify where AMIDST should write seed history to. If AMIDST cannot find a file at the path you've specified, it will attempt to make one. If it cannot make one, it will simply not log your seed history.
	- A new option is availible in the Options menu called "Show Debug Info". Enabling this will add a small panel to the map viewer containing debug information on fragments.
	- More windows will now use the AMIDST icon.
	- Mac OS X users should no longer experience the "corrupted" issue.
	- A licenses window has been added to the help menu. This will contain all relevant license information for AMIDST and its libraries.
	- AMIDST is now under GPL v3
	- Added a "-mcpath <file>" flag for users to specify the path to their .minecraft directory.
	- Changing color profiles is now much faster as fragments regenerate from cache instead of rebuilding the entire map.
	- The default version is now 1.7.4.
	- Most crashes now create a "crash dialog" containing a log that can easily be pasted.
	- Added "-log <file>" flag. Using this flag will cause AMIDST to write all log output to the specified file. AMIDST should create a file if it does not exist.
	- AMIDST now returns "4" on crashes. This will change at a later date to include various error codes.
	- Added 1.7.4 to official version list.
	- Added smooth fragment fading. (This may be disabled in the options menu) Enabling this will cause all fragments to fade in when loaded.
	- Added option to set the default world type to any of the world types or "prompt each time".

	Version bump.

	Upstream changelog:
	- Added an actual error message for the elusive "Unable to find critical external class while loading." error.
	- Biome profiles containing syntax errors will no longer cause the entire profile list to not load.
	- Libraries correctly load based on OS and JSON rules provided.
	- Libraries now load the ".jar" file in a directory rather than the first file.

	* 3.6_beta_1-1 :
	Version bump.

	- Twitch libraries have been added to the exclude list.
	- Attempting to load AMIDST with a missing library no longer results in a crash unless that library was required.
	- Rendering speed has been GREATLY improved on some (most) computers.
	- An option has been added to the biome profile menu to reload the list of profiles. (Shortcut: CTRL + B)
	- AMIDST no longer keeps color profiles (and other json files) open after reading them.
	- Duplicate colors in profiles are now supported.
	- default.json now looks much cleaner when generated.
	- Color profiles may now include an "alias" for that biome. (It will come up when you hover over the biome)

	* 3.5_beta_1-1 :
	Version bump.

	Upstream changelog (since 3.5-test-build):
	- Fixed a bug where Mega Spruce Tiaga would show up as black if you changed the color profile. (Note: This will require any custom profiles you've made to also include a "Mega Spruce Tiaga (Hills)" entry, as the issue was from having Mega Spruce Tiaga link to two biomes)
	- Added library loading based on the jar's json file. (Note: If no json file is found, no libraries will be loaded... this may be changed in the future. Additionally, lwjgl, jinput, and any OS requirements are currently ignored)
