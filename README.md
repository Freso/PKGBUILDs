Moved to BitBucket
==================

Since [GitHub's decision to disable uploads](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads)
I have decided to move repositories which either will need a place to store
packaged files or does not need GitHub's more advanced features off of GitHub.
This includes my ArchLinux PKGBUILDs repository.

The choice has fallen on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). They provide many
of the same features of GitHub and has a similar interface. And they support
Git, in addition to other DVCS's.

My PKGBUILDs repository can now be found here:
  https://bitbucket.org/Freso/pkgbuilds

Feel free to fork and make pull requests over there.

Cheers!
